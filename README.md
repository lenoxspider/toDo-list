# toDo-list
This program is a simple to-do list manager that lets users add tasks and view them once they’re done entering tasks.
How It Works:
- Users enter tasks one by one.
- When they are finished, they press Enter without typing anything.
- The program then displays all tasks in a list format.
- It also shows how many times the user entered a task.
Commands You Can Use:
- Enter a task → Adds the task to the list.
- Press Enter (empty input) → Shows all tasks and the number of entries.
- Exit the program → This happens automatically after displaying the list.
Notes:
- The program does not remove or edit tasks, it only records them.
- It keeps track of the number of times a user added a task.
- Tasks are stored temporarily and are not saved after exiting.
It's a quick and straightforward way to note tasks in a session! Let me know if you’d like enhancements. ✅
